  3. Any user who navigates to this post can be affected by this exploit, here I used just a simple alert(1)

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while doing the work

In the youtube exploit, I actually mixed single and double quotes at one point and it wasn't functioning properly.

For the comment section exploit, finding 64kb of text was a bit rough, and it repeatedly sends alerts so it can be very damaging to users.
